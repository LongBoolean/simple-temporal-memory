simple-temporal-memory
======================

An implementation of a Hierarchical temporal memory (machine learning algorithm) based off of the ideas proposed by Jeff Hawkins (founder of Numenta). Numenta allows the use of their IP for non-commercial purposes. For those interested in learning more about HTM technology please visit the Numenta website as well as the NuPic project here on GitHub.

Compile information:

	cd into the src/ directory and type 'make' followed by 'make run' 
	
	no special libs required
	
	developed/tested on linux
	
	uses some elements of c++11

Background information:

	I have a found this topic very interesting and just felt an incredible urge to try and implement some of these algorithms. 
	Here is what I have to show for it so far...


This project is still heavily in development. 
For this reason many features are either buggy or nonexistent.
